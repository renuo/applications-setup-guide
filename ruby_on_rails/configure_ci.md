# Configure the CI

It's now time to configure our CI to run the tests.
The command to run the tests is `bin/check`.
You can follow the section about [Configuring a CI](../configure_ci.md) to setup it properly on [SemaphoreCI](https://semaphoreci.com).


When you have your three green builds you have configured your CI properly.
To proceed further we need to create our servers and then configure the Continuous Deployment.
