# Favicons

You can use the gem `real-favicon-rails` for easy integration.
Note that the customer can generate the icons, and then he can send you the JSON code which is displayed in the RoR tab.

Real Favicon Generator (http://realfavicongenerator.net/) is a service that allows us to generate favicons for all formats and devices.

If the Website is live already you can check the state and compatibility of its favicons by scrolling to the bottom of the page and checking an URL.

If you generate new favicons from scratch, there are a few thing to be aware of:

* You should start out with an image which is at least 260px by 260px
* Your image should have a transparent background (PNG format)
* When following the generation steps on the wizard, be sure to keep all of them similar (same background etc.)

Once you generated the icons, the integration instructions are displayed on the website.
