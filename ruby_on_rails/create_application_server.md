# Setup Heroku Application

It's time to setup a new Heroku Application.
If you don't know what is Heroku please [read it](https://www.heroku.com/platform).

You should have an Heroku Account already.

Run the command `renuo create-heroku-app [project-name]` to generate a script which will create and configure all
Heroku apps.

Please review the script before running it and execute only the commands you need and understand.

**If you don't know what a command does: read the documentation and then execute it.**

If you think that the script is outdated please open a
Pull Request on the [renuo-cli](https://github.com/renuo/renuo-cli) project.
