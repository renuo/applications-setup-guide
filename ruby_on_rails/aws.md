# Amazon Services

## Amazon S3

S3 is Amazon's Simple Cloud Storage Serviceâ€Ž, and used in most of your projects to store images and
files

## Amazon CloudFront

CloudFront is a large scale, global, and feature rich CDN. We mostly use it together with S3, since fetching data from S3 is only
possible together with CloudFront. You could also host a Single Page Application (SPA), but for that, we most often use Google Firebase.

## Setup

### Preconditions

You will need Renuo-CLI to be set up and at the newest version:

`gem install renuo-cli` --> see [renuo-cli](https://github.com/renuo/renuo-cli)

Make sure `renuo -v` shows the [newest version](https://github.com/renuo/renuo-cli/tags)

### Start the Setup

The following command will guide you through a setup to be able to run all the commands, you
will receive, to set up aws (and CloudFront)

1. Run `renuo create-aws-project`
1. Follow the steps and answer the questions
1. Now it will print you out a series of commands e.g.:

```sh
# AWS master

      aws --profile renuo-app-setup iam create-user --user-name <<your-project>>
      [...]

# AWS develop
[...]
```

1. Copy and run the commands environment per environment. After each environment,
it will print you out the credentials as a `json`. Copy `SecretAccessKey` and `AccessKeyId` to
your credentials store:

```json
{
  "AccessKey": {
      "UserName": "***",
      "Status": "***",
      "CreateDate": "***",
      "SecretAccessKey": "*** STORE THIS KEY ***",
      "AccessKeyId": "*** STORE THIS KEY ***"
  }
}
```

1. Repeat the previous step for all environments
1. (Only if using CloudFront) Make sure, you know also the Domain name of your CloudFront-Distribution to access your s3 files
(e.g. ***.cloudfront.net or the Alias, if using an Alias).
