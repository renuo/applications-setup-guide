# Ruby On Rails - Application Setup Guide

This setup covers a pure, monolithic Rails application.
This is the most frequent type of application at [Renuo](https://renuo.ch) and is probably the easiest to set up.
The application (and its GitHub repo) will be named after the `[project-name]` you chose before.

> [!NOTE]
> Have you chosen a `[project-name]` yet? If not, please do so now. Check our [Naming Conventions](../naming_conventions.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Have you decided if you need two environments (develop and main) or just one?
> As a rule of thumb: for customers we always use two environments, for internal projects we usually only use one.
> Why the difference? Because we can bear the risk of having a bug in an internal project, but we cannot do that for a customer.
> Decide with your team if you want one or two branches.

> [!TIP]
> Sections marked with ✨ are already set up by the Renuo Rails template or ship with Rails 8.1 by default. You only need to verify them, not install them.

## Step 1: Create the App

1. [Initialise the Rails Application](app_initialisation.md)
1. [Push to Git Repository](first_git_push.md)
1. [Initialise Gitflow](initialise_gitflow.md)
1. [Configure GitHub Repository](../configure_github_repository.md)

## Step 2: Deploy the App

1. [Create an Application Server for Deploio](create_application_server_deploio.md) or [Create an Application Server for Heroku](create_application_server_heroku.md) or (if there is no other way) [Set up a VPS](https://github.com/renuo/vps-setup-guide/blob/main/README.md)
1. [Configure the CI/CD](configure_ci.md)

Your app should now be up and running on all environments.

## Step 3: Quality Tools

Set up the tools that help your team maintain high quality throughout development.

1. [RSpec](rspec.md)
1. [Linting and automatic checks](linting_and_automatic_check.md)
1. [Gems and libraries 💎](suggested_libraries.md)
1. [Cloudflare](cloudflare.md)

Your team can now start working on the project.

## Step 4: Monitoring & Protection

Set these up while the rest of the team starts working. Most are not optional, but they don't block other work.

1. [AppSignal](appsignal.md)
1. [Sentry](sentry.md) (optional)
1. [NewRelic](newrelic.md) (optional)
1. [robots.txt](robots_txt.md)
1. [Percy](configure_percy.md) (optional)
1. [Protect develop environment](environment_protection.md)

## Step 5: Customer Plan Services

Bookmark the project on [Redmine](https://dashboard.renuo.ch/redmine_projects) and configure the services listed there.

1. [Uptimerobot](uptimerobot.md)
1. [Sentry notifications](sentry.md), if requested
1. [Depfu security monitoring](depfu.md)
1. [Papertrail alerts](papertrail.md), if requested
