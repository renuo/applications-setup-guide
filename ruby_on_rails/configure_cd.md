# Configure the CD

There are many ways to configure a Continuous Deployment.
Since we used SemaphoreCI for the CI and Heroku as a server we suggest to [use SemaphoreCI also for the deployment](../configure_cd.md) since it's very easy to set up.

You have now your application running on all the three environments. From now on, all the changes you will push on develop or master will be automatically deployed to the relative server.
Itâ€™s time to create some first Pull Requests with some improvements that you are going to need absolutely in a proper Renuo Rails Application
