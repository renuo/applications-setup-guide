# Initialise Gitflow

You can initialise gitflow in you project with `git flow init -d`

Then push also your new develop branch `git push --set-upstream origin develop` if you have one.

Once you have pushed all the branches, you can finish the [configuration of Git Repository](../configure_git_repository.md)
