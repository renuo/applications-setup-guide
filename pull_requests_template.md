# Pull Requests Template

You should probably configure a template for the Pull Requests in your project.

This template will give a list of reminders and important points that the developer
needs to remember when (s)he opens a new Pull Request.

We think this template is useful as a checklist of things that shouldn't be forgotten
when assigning a Pull Request to one of your colleagues.

Feel free to personalise the template for your project specific needs.
If you think your changes would be useful also in other projects,
please open a Pull Request to update this template.

To install the template copy this file into a `.github` folder in your project or
simply run the following command from the root folder of the project:

```bash
mkdir -p .github && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renuo/applications-setup-guide/master/templates/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md > .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```
