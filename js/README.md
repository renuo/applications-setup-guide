# Frontend apps

## Trivial app

Consider using only static files (example: [Green Card Predictor](https://github.com/renuo/green-card-probability-frontend))
and CDNs.

## Simple JS app

If you need a really simple JavaScript application and you need more than just an *index.html*, you can checkout this template:
<https://github.com/renuo/tamedia-altersheime/tree/dab2bb6f1bb4c7776e965d227de5b63e06240624>

It contains a very simple *webpack* configuration (production ready) featuring:

* Cucumber tests
* Fonts
* Images
* Favicon

The rest is done in these three files:

* index.html
* index.css
* index.js

## Complex JS app

Use either React or [Angular](../angular/README.md).
