# Simple JS App

If you need a really simple JavaScript application and you need more than just an *index.html*, you can checkout this template:
https://github.com/renuo/tamedia-altersheime/tree/0a5fc447bc7fdae9b81bbe0918ca64c864c58354

It contains a very simple *webpack* configuration (production ready) featuring:

* Cucumber tests
* Fonts
* Images
* Favicon

The rest is done in these three files:

* index.html
* index.css
* index.js
