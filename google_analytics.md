# Google analytics

We want to setup google analytics separately for each of our heroku apps (master, develop, testing).

To add a new project to the GA account go to <https://www.google.com/analytics> and login as google@renuo.ch.

1. Go to the tab 'Verwalten' and you will see a dropdown on the left with all the project
1. Chose the lowest one that says 'Neues Konto hinzuf√ºgen'
1. Fill out the Data based on your project. (Only select the upper two check-boxes in the end)
1. In Property Management, make sure you have activated the option "Enable Demographics and Interest Reports"/"Berichte zur Leistung nach demografischen Merkmalen und Interesse aktivieren"
1. Once you saved the Account you will see the tracking snippet.
1. **deprecated**: If you are using rack-google-analytics then add the advertising: true option

```ruby
config.middleware.use Rack::GoogleAnalytics, anonymize_ip: true, advertising: true, tracker: ENV['GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID']  if Rails.env.production?
```

7. If you are not using rack-google-analytics, between

```js
ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');
```

fill in this line

```js
ga('require', 'displayfeatures');
```

and before them introduce this one:

```js
ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);
```

so in the end, it is adapted like this:

```js
ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');
ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);
ga('require', 'displayfeatures');
ga('send', 'pageview');
```

8. Write down the tracking ID (the string in the snippet with all caps and starting with an UX-XXX....) and note it - you will need it for the heroku config

Do this for all 3 branches, but instead of adding an account, add a property for the second and the third branch.
