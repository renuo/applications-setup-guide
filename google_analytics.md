# Google analytics

We want to setup google analytics separately for each of our heroku apps (master, develop, testing).

To add a new project to the GA account go to https://www.google.com/analytics and login as google@renuo.ch.

1. Go to the tab 'Verwalten' and you will see a dropdown on the left with all the project
2. Chose the lowest one that says 'Neues Konto hinzuf√ºgen'
3. Fill out the Data based on your project. (Only select the upper two check-boxes in the end)
4. In Property Management, make sure you have activated the option "Enable Demographics and Interest Reports"/"Berichte zur Leistung nach demografischen Merkmalen und Interesse aktivieren"
5. Once you saved the Account you will see the tracking snippet. 
6. If you are using rack-google-analytics then add the advertising: true option
```
config.middleware.use Rack::GoogleAnalytics, anonymize_ip: true, advertising: true, tracker: ENV['GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID']  if Rails.env.production?
```
7. If you are not using rack-google-analytics, between   
```
ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');
ga('send', 'pageview');
```
fill in this line
```
ga('require', 'displayfeatures');```
and before them introduce this one:
```
ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);
```
so in the end, it is adapted like this:
```
ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');
ga('set', 'anonymizeIp', true);
ga('require', 'displayfeatures');
ga('send', 'pageview');
```
8. Write down the tracking ID (the string in the snippet with all caps and starting with an UX-XXX....) and note it - you will need it for the heroku config

Do this for all 3 branches, but instead of adding an account, add a property for the second and the third branch.
