# Auto Deploy

This is simple.

Go to https://<deployment-server>/deployment_configs/new

Add three new configs for each respective branch. Click on deploy for each of these links.

Finally, copy the three links to the github project and add them as hooks for the push event. Remember to copy all of the 3 links.
