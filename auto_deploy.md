# Auto Deploy

This is simple.

Go to https://<deployment-server>/deployment_configs/new

Add three new configs for each respective branch. Click on deploy for each of these links.

~~Finally, copy the three links to the github project and add them as hooks for the push event. Remember to copy all 3 links.~~

No need to copy any hooks - the global commit hook is setup automatically.
