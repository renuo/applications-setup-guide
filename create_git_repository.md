# Create a Git Repository

At Renuo we currently use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as our git repository. You should already be part of the Renuo Organisation and have permissions to do so.
If that's not the case double check the Laptop Setup Guide or ask wg-operations.

To create a new GitHub project you can use the tool you prefer but it should have the following characteristics:
* Should be under `renuo` organisation
* Should have `[project-name]` as a name
* Should be private (unless you are creating an OpenSource project)

Use the command `hub create renuo/[project-name]` to create the repo and add it to the origin of the current folder.
